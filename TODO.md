TODOS
=====

* More user-friendly installation (including dependencies)
* Blender UI addon to pre-populate code window with slice definition code
* Remove `triangle` dependency in favor of fill/beautify fill (It should handle holes)
* Implement face slices feature (see below)


### Face slices

Instead of defining a slice with the coordinates of a plane, use a face on the mesh 
as the plane. To build hollow containers instead of having parts going through 
the object. Cuts would need to work differenly, like finger joints?
