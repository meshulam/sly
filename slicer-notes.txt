Slicer: Classes for 3D construction from 2D parts

## Slice

A 2D cutout positioned in 3d space.

Consists of:
- A polygon (initially the Shapely polygon implementation)
- A 3d->2d transformation:
    - Normal vector of the slice's plane in the 3d coordinate system (vec3)
    - The location of hte plane's origin in 3d space (vec3)
- Thickness (float)
- Slots - Interface between the slice and another slice. (Actually contained in a super-object? Scene/model?)

## Scene
Many slices in their own planes. Keeps track of slots between them. 

## Slot
Interface btween 2 slices. Knows how thick the slices are and where they intersect. When instantiated, knows
where the slices get cut to fit together. Can transform a slice's polygon geometry by cutting the slot explicitly
(for rendering or output to vector/gcode). Can also be kept separate to keep slots on a different toolpath


## Plane - The 3d-2d transformation mentioned above
